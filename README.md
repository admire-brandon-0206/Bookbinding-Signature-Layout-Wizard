# PDF-Signature-Creator

This program takes in a PDF and rearragnes and outputs into signatures for bookbinding.

In bookbinding pages are split into mini-booklets called signatures that are then sewn together. Since the mini booklets each have a spine, layout of the pages by hand is difficult and prone to error, especially for larger projects. This program aims to automate the process and take human error out of the question.


TO DO:
------
-Add multi PDF support
-Add scaling and multiple paper size options. (Currenly handled by print dialoge)
